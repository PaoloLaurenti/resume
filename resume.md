## About

I am a software developer with a great passion for my job.    
I try to continuously improve myself in order to produce better software; I love to work in an environment that considers quality a number one priority and strives to get things done in the most efficient way.   
I am a fast learner and an effective team player: I am happy when I am surrounded by people more skilled than me but at the same time I love sharing with everyone what I know.    
I enjoy to experiment new technologies; functional languages, distributed computing, scalability issues are the challenges with which I'd like to work.   
I'd love to work with BEAM technologies like Elixir and Erlang languages because I am very fascinated by the power of the BEAM VM and the wonderful implementation of the actor model mixed with the functional approach.
